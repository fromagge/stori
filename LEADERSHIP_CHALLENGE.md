## Leadership challenge (written test)

### Scenario

Your team is tasked with developing a new feature for the Flutter app that
involves integrating a complex API written in GoLang. The team is facing
challenges in understanding the API specifications and coordinating between
the Flutter and GoLang developers. Additionally, there are conflicting
opinions on the best approach to implement this feature.

### 1. How would you approach resolving conflicts within the team regarding technical decisions?

There's a lot on topics to approach in a situation like this, but the first thing is to take the rails and address the
most important and criticals aspects

1. **Understand the problem**: The first thing is to understand the problem, what is the conflict about? Is it about the
   API specifications? Is it about the integration between Flutter and GoLang? Is it about the best approach to
   implement the feature? Understanding the problem is the first step to solve it.

2. **Listen to the team**: The team is the one that is facing the problem, so it's important to listen to them. What are
   their opinions? What are their concerns? What are their suggestions? Listening to the team is important to understand
   the different perspectives and to find a common ground.

3. **Facilitate a discussion and find a common ground**: Once you understand the problem and listen to the team, it's
   important to facilitate a discussion and find a common ground. This can be done by discussing the pros and cons of
   each approach, by finding the common goals and objectives, and by finding a compromise that satisfies everyone. It's
   important to note that most of this conversation needs to be focused towards factual data and not personal preference
   by either parties. This means that any opinion needs to be supported with data/use cases/objective experience. Also
   sometimes this decisions needs to be focused towards a bussines decisions rather than a technical one, and if so, is
   it important to find the better approach to comply with the business side and not affecting to much the technical
   side.

4. **Set goals and conclusions**: Whilst this discussions can take some time to address properly, it is important to do
   so in an early stage, and to involve the whole team, and others if needed to avoid future changes or delays, and
   specially for everyone to be on the same page.

### 2. Describe a strategy you would use to ensure effective communication and collaboration between the GoLang and Flutter developers.

Finding familiarity and references for both parties into what is essecially unknown to them is key to close the gap
between both teams.
Golang developers might be more focused on the structure backend side of the application, rendering almost all of the
frontend works to Flutter developer but without a guide or reference between the two, is going to turn into caos.

A middle ground: API documentation on both ends. This is a good way to start, as it will give both sides a clear
overview on what they need from each other and how to achieve it. This will also help to avoid any misunderstandings or
misinterpretations of the requirements.

For complex flows, a diagram or a flowchart can be a good way to visualize the process and to make sure that everyone
is.

Also things like meetings discussing progress and functionalities from both parties is important to not only understand
more about the business but also to keep the team motivated and on the same page and probably find new ways to improve.

Last but not least, on some teams it might be a good idea to get their feet on the water with litter Knowledge Transfer
sessions for both parties to get a better understanding of the other side of the coin.

### 3. How do you motivate and empower team members to take ownership of their tasks while maintaining a cohesive team dynamic.

Listening to the team is the most important pilar in order to build trust and to create a REAL sense of ownership. This
is done by taking faith in the team and their capabilities, and by giving them the freedom to make decisions and to take
ownership of their tasks step by step.

An example: In a newly constructed team, it is important to give them the freedom to make decisions and to take
ownership in small doses and in a controlled environment, this will help them to build confidence and to take more
ownership in the future. Eventually bigger tasks and more responsibilities will create a higher sense of autonomy,
responsibility and accountability, this, off course, without affecting priorities or their work life balance.

Transparency and open communication is also key to motivate and empower team members. This can be done by sharing both
good and bad news in both ends, and by involving the team in the decision-making process. This will help to build trust
and to create a sense of ownership and responsibility. Being reciprocal with feedback is also important, whether is a
good or bad idea, is important to communicate it in a healthy manner and to try always to make a positive impact on your
team members.

### 4. Share an experience where you successfully led a team through a challenging project delivery, highlighting your leadership style and the key strategies you employed.

At my last job, I had to opportunity to lead a team of 4 developers through a challenging project delivery, frontend
react developers and a single python developer.

One of the biggest challenges with react developers was to unify the code style and the way they were working, as they
were
many components and pieces involved, we needed everyone hands on but also thoughtful on their decisions. We achieve with
the help of some tools:

1. Proper technical and bussiness introduction of the product. This allowed the team to understand the product and the
   technical set up that we were going to use.

2. Code reviews and team meetings to create a new high level component to understand what pieces needed to be done and
   how to do it.

3. Guidelines on how to work with the code, this was a big one, as it helped to unify the code style and the way they
   were working, not only style sie but also logically, this avoided many conflicts and misunderstandings.

4. Regular 1:1 meetings to understand the team members concerns and to help them to solve them, this was specially
   helpful with individual struggles both on technical and business side.

With the backend developer, the most important part was to encourage good practices, since I was leaving the project it
was important to understand that the team was going to be on their own, so I needed to make sure that they were going to
be able to handle the project without me. This was done by:

1. Explaining architectural decisions and the reasons behind them, this helped the backend developer to understand the
   project and to make better decisions in the future.

2. Presenting different patters that were used in the project and ones that weren't used, and their reasons why it might
   be a good idea to not follow.

3. Technical compromises that were made to satisfy the business side, this was important to understand that sometimes
   the technical side needs to be compromised to satisfy the business side.

4. Standard security practices, how to find them, how to implement them and how to be aware of them.

On both sides communication was important since frontend developers of this project didn't had backend experience, so
they relied a lot on the documentation provided by the backend developer, and the backend developer needed to understand
the frontend needs and how to provide them.

When I've had to lead people I always like to remind them that I'm more a guide than a boss, and I like to give trust to
my team members to encourage them. I was (am) transparent and open with them, and to involve them in the decision-making.
Leadership is about building leaders, not followers.
